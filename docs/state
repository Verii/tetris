The game state -- when you pause and leave a game -- will be stored in
plaintext to disk in JSON format. This is the 'lightweight' solutions. I think
it's the best approach, as storing the game state is temporary, will be removed
after restoring, and only requires one 'save'. Using an SQL DB would be
over-complicating the situation.

Game state will be stored locally in "~/.local/share/lw-games/tetris/state", or
optionally specified in the configuration file.
