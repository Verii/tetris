Saving mid-game will write the following necessary variables to the database:
level, name, score, difficulty, dimensions, and block spaces.

The game board is currently 12x24 (COLUMNS, ROWS), plus two ROWS above the game
that the player doesn't interact with. Each ROW is stored as a (2-byte) bit
field. Thus the entire board state can fit into 48 bytes.

Game state will be stored locally in "~/.local/share/tetris/saves".
