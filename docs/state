Saving mid-game will write the following necessary variables to the database:
level, name, score, difficulty and block spaces.

The game board is currently 8x16 (COLUMNS, ROWS), plus two ROWS above the game
that the player doesn't interact with. Each ROW is stored as a bit field in a
single byte. Thus the entire board state can fit into 16 bytes.

Game state will be stored locally in "~/.local/share/tetris/saves".
