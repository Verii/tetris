The game is presented as an ncurses display in a terminal. Its commands are
input by the user at the keyboard through several key combinations:

To move the current falling block horizontally press the 'a' and 'd' keys.
The user can also use the left and right arrow keys.

To rotate the current falling block press the 'q' and 'e' keys.
'q' will rotate counter-clockwise and 'e' will rotate clockwise.

To speed up the falling block the 's' or down arrow key will advance the
falling block one step. Note that this does *not* reset the fall timer.

To save the next piece for later, press the space bar. If successful, a new
field will display on screen alerting the user of the current save piece. 
Press the space bar again to restore the current save piece. The save piece
will *replace* the next piece. The 'next' piece will not be saved or pushed
back, a new random next piece will be generated.

The save piece keeps its location even after being saved and restored.
