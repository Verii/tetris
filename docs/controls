The game is presented as an ncurses display in a terminal. Its commands are
input by the user at the keyboard through several key combinations:

To rotate the current falling block press the 'q' and 'e' keys.
'q' will rotate counter-clockwise and 'e' will rotate clockwise.

To move the current falling block horizontally press the 'a' and 'd' keys.
To speed up the falling block the 's' will advance the falling block one step.
To make the block wall to the bottom, the 'w' key can be used.

To save the next piece for later, press the space bar. If successful, a new
field will display on screen alerting the user of the current save piece. 
Saving a piece will move the next piece to the save position, a new next piece
will be created. 'Restoring' a save piece replaces the current save piece will
the current next piece.
