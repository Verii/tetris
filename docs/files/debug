debug.h contains macros to present a cleaner logging interface to the program

there is no functional difference to log_info or log_warn

log_warn writes [WARN] messages to stderr
log_info writes [INFO] messages to stderr
log_err writes [ERROR] messages to stderr, it also flushes all streams.
	should the program crash it should be easier to find where things
	went wrong.

debug writes [DEBUG] messages to stderr, only compiles in if DEBUG is defined

debug_log is a function that prints the time and date of the message
	macros defined above are wrappers that prefix [WARNS|INFO|DEBUG|ERROR]
	and include the file and line number where the function was called.
