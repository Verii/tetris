db.c contains the implementation of the SQLite3 database wrappers.

db_info structure contains information about a database, including:
	the internal sqlite3 handler
	the name of the file containing the database
	and a unique handler.

Thinking more about this now, the "unique handler" needs to be moved to the
game structure, and removed from db_info. TODO.


The functions below will open the database for reading/writing themselves,
perform their tasks, and then close the database.

db_results struct contains information about a specific game highscore.
It is returned by db_get_scores in a linked-list format.

int db_save_state() writes to the database specified in db_info, the current
board position and state. It can be resumed from later by db_resume_state.

int db_resume_state() see above. It will also remove the pulled entry from the
database, to prevent abuse from the users.

int db_save_score() does much the same, but it ammends the game score/level/etc. 
to the database for lookup.

the macro db_clean_scores cleans up after db_get_scores().


We have a few char arrays defining several SQL commands. Those are self
explanatory if you understand SQL.

Finally, we have wrapper functions for sqlite3_open, and sqlite3_close.
